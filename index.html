	<h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
	<br>
	<p>I am a 14 year old boy, who lives in the Philippines, the <em>Pearl of the Orient Seas.</em> You may wonder, this about me is weird, its like I was convicted of high degree murder. But its not, I am just convicted for being <strong>cool.</strong> First Quarter of ICT has been a real pain in the head, and I was struggling. But I love ICT, because its hard, and its fun. In all seriousness, I dedicated myself to making documents for communities, and I am still learning how to code, and how to create an efficient webpage for everyone. I love documents.</p>
	<h2>Interests</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Document Making - I used to make documents for communities</li>
		<li>Gaming - To clarify document making for communities, these communities are gaming communities, in which I contributed to creating documents. and now, I want to implement coding and creating webpags</li>
		<li>Music - I love music. yipee!!</li>
